# Hey, I'm Sriram 👋
I'm a 19-year-old developer on a self-taught journey — learning by doing, and building up the skills to launch my own SaaS product by the end of 2025, followed by a hardware + software product in early 2026.

## 🧠 Right now:
Focused on learning and growing as a developer

## 🛠️ What I know so far:
Languages: C, C++, Python
Tools: Git, Pandas
More coming as I learn and build

## 🚧 Projects:
I'm uploading some of my projects I did after learning — each one shows what I’ve picked up so far.
- [CryptWarden](https://github.com/sudosriram/cryptwarden)
- [BookRanker](https://github.com/sudosriram/bookranker)

## 🌱 How I learn:
Not a traditional classroom learner. I follow online resources, break stuff, build stuff, and repeat — that’s how I grow.
